# Analysis on some racing data
this was an assignment for *COMP257 - Data science*. The task was to perform a basic analysis of the provided dataset.
## Basic Questions

* What is the average speed of the rider?
* Plot histograms showing the distribution of speed, heart rate and power over the ride.
* plot power vs speed and power vs heart rate - is there a relationship?
* how many laps did the rider complete in the race?

## Extension Questions

* find the average speed of the rider in racer2.gpx. (you will need to make an assumption about the logging frequency)
* work out the time taken for each lap in the race by each rider.
* who was fastest and by how much

I went a little over the specifications.
To complete the assignment, basic use of pandas and matplotlib was used, as well as some janky use of a scipy function to find peaks.
